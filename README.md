## UX

When decidind on the Project 5 - I had a look around at other people project and to see what fits me best, so I thought the webdesigner would be a good idea as hopefully becoming a Dev.
 - Chose the colour that is web accessbititly 
 - Using the User Story, Wireframe, Kaban that helps build the website.

### Colour Scheme 

I have chose the color blue as the main colour because,

The colour Blue is so significant to Deaf people, Deaf community and also is the colour of the Irish Deaf Society
Dark blue was chosen by the World Federation of the Deaf and Deaf associations around the World to represent Deafhood. That means an individual and collective journey to campaign against audism and a focus on the positivity of Deaf identities, including Sign Languages, Deaf Culture and Deaf History. 

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/274c77-1a3a5f-e6e8eb-f8f9fa-ffffff) to generate my colour palette.
