## Introduction
Deaf Design is a web design company: Founded and operated by Deaf professionals, dedicated to creating visually stunning and accessible websites that bridge the gap between the Deaf & people and hearing communities. Our team of talented Deaf designers brings a unique perspective to the digital landscape, leveraging their heightened visual acuity and innate understanding of visual communication to craft websites that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also intuitively navigable. 

The goal was to have a website on basis that I hopefully will become a web dev.
