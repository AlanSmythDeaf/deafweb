## Introduction
Deaf Design is a web design company: Founded and operated by Deaf professionals, dedicated to creating visually stunning and accessible websites that bridge the gap between the Deaf & people and hearing communities. Our team of talented Deaf designers brings a unique perspective to the digital landscape, leveraging their heightened visual acuity and innate understanding of visual communication to craft websites that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also intuitively navigable. 

The goal was to have a website on basis that I hopefully will become a web dev.

## UX
When decide on the Project 5 - I was thinking about how to do ecommerce that is not the same as  boutiuq ado, want to see if I can do it slightly different so went webdesign business. 
### Idea
 - Chose the colour that is web accessbititly 
 - Using the User Story, Wireframe, Kaban that helps build the website.

### Structure
Scope Plane - 

### Colour Scheme 
I have chose the color blue as the main colour
The colour Blue is so significant to Deaf people, Deaf community and also is the colour of the Irish Deaf Society
Dark blue was chosen by the World Federation of the Deaf and Deaf associations around the World to represent Deafhood.
I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/274c77-1a3a5f-e6e8eb-ffffff-f8f9fa) to generate my colour palette.

## Database Design
Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD) help to visualise database architecture before creating models.
I have used pygraphviz and django-extensions to auto-generate an ERD.

The steps taken were as follows:

- In the terminal: sudo apt update
- then: sudo apt-get install python3-dev graphviz libgraphviz-dev pkg-config
- then type Y to proceed
- then: pip3 install django-extensions pygraphviz
- in my settings.py file, I added the following to my INSTALLED_APPS
  
- 'django_extensions'
  
- back in the terminal: python3 manage.py graph_models -a -o erd.png
- dragged the new erd.png file into my documentation/ folder
- removed 'django_extensions', from my INSTALLED_APPS
- finally, in the terminal: pip3 uninstall django-extensions pygraphviz -y

## Agile Development Process
how to explain ????????

### GitHub Projects
[GitHub Projects](https://github.com/AlanSmythDeaf/deafchat/projects) served as an Agile tool for this project.
It isn't a specialized tool, but with the right tags and project creation/issue assignments, it can be made to work.
Through it, user stories, issues, and milestone tasks were planned, then tracked on a weekly basis using the basic Kanban board.
screenshot Projects Board.

### GitHub Issues
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/AlanSmythDeaf/deafchat/issues) served as an another Agile tool.
There, I used my own **User Story Template** to manage user stories.
It also helped with milestone iterations on a weekly basis.
screenshot of Open and Closed Issues.

### MoSCOw
It's a method that prioritzation technique used in management, The acronym MoSCoW represents four categories of initiatives: must-have, should-have, could-have, and won't-have, or will not have right now. I use Must-have and should-have for planning the website. The most important is using should which I should use.

### Ecommerce Business Model

### Search Engine Optimization (SEO) & Social Media Marketing
### Keywords
### Sitemap
### Robtos
## Social Media
### Facebook
Create a MockUp Facebook
Having a social media presence is essential for e-commerce businesses because it significantly expands their reach and enhances customer engagement beyond what a standalone website can achieve. Social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok boast billions of active users. Unlike websites, which rely on users actively seeking them out, social media allows businesses to meet potential customers where they already spend their time, increasing visibility and brand recognition.
I've set up a Facebook business account to establish a presence for my e-commerce brand. This account will serve as a platform to connect with potential customers, showcase products, share updates, and build engagement.
|Facebook Page | Facebook Post |

### Newsletter
To recieved the newsletter, the user will need to subscribe to the newsletter by entering an email adress. This is located at the bottom of the page. At first I used Django and then change it to using the MailChimp newsletter
|Subscribe | When the user enter email address |

## Testing
> [!NOTE]  
> For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file. (not yet)

## Deployment

The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://ddesign-pp5-01f27d10398c.herokuapp.com/).

### PostgreSQL Database

This project uses a [Code Institute PostgreSQL Database](https://dbs.ci-dbs.net).

To obtain my own Postgres Database from Code Institute, I followed these steps:

- Signed-in to the CI LMS using my email address.
- An email was sent to me with my new Postgres Database.

> [!CAUTION]  
> - PostgreSQL databases by Code Institute are only available to CI Students.
> - You must acquire your own PostgreSQL database through some other method
> if you plan to clone/fork this repository.
> - Code Institute students are allowed a maximum of 8 databases.
> - Databases are subject to deletion after 18 months.

### Cloudinary API

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set your environment variables.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is a sample only; you would replace the values with your own if cloning/forking my repository.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | user's own value |
| `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` | 1 (*this is temporary, and can be removed for the final deployment*) |
| `SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |

Heroku needs three additional files in order to deploy properly.

- requirements.txt
- Procfile
- runtime.txt

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:

- `echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile`
- *replace **app_name** with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where settings.py is located*

The **runtime.txt** file needs to know which Python version you're using:
1. type: `python3 --version` in the terminal.
2. in the **runtime.txt** file, add your Python version:
	- `python-3.9.19`

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:

- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level,
and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is a sample only; you would replace the values with your own if cloning/forking my repository.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("CLOUDINARY_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
```

Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:

- Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Stop the app once it's loaded: `CTRL+C` or `⌘+C` (Mac)
- Make any necessary migrations: `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
- Migrate the data to the database: `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Load fixtures (if applicable): `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json` (repeat for each file)
- Everything should be ready now, so run the Django app again: `python3 manage.py runserver`

#### Cloning

You can clone the repository by following these steps:

1. Go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AlanSmythDeaf/deafweb) 
2. Locate the Code button above the list of files and click it 
3. Select if you prefer to clone using HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI and click the copy button to copy the URL to your clipboard
4. Open Git Bash or Terminal
5. Change the current working directory to the one where you want the cloned directory
6. In your IDE Terminal, type the following command to clone my repository:
	- `git clone https://github.com/AlanSmythDeaf/deafchat.git`
7. Press Enter to create your local clone.

Alternatively, if using Gitpod, you can click below to create your own workspace using this repository.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/AlanSmythDeaf/deafchat)

Please note that in order to directly open the project in Gitpod, you need to have the browser extension installed.
A tutorial on how to do that can be found [here](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-extension).

#### Forking

By forking the GitHub Repository, we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original owner's repository.
You can fork this repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/AlanSmythDeaf/deafweb)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. Once clicked, you should now have a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account!
