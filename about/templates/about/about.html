        <h2>Our History and Mission</h2>
        <p>
            Established in 2020, Deaf Design was born out of a vision to empower Deaf individuals 
            in the tech industry while simultaneously addressing the need for more inclusive 
            digital spaces. Our founders, all graduates of Gallaudet University, were inspired by 
            the success of Deaf entrepreneurs in various fields and saw an opportunity to make a 
            significant impact in the web design sector. Our mission is twofold: to create exceptional,
            user-centric websites that cater to both Deaf and hearing users, and to advocate for 
            greater representation and opportunities for Deaf professionals in the tech industry. 
            We believe that Deafness should not limit opportunity, and we strive to challenge society's 
            perceptions by showcasing the unique talents and perspectives that Deaf individuals bring 
            to web design. At Deaf Design, we are committed to:
